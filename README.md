# student_dashboard
For all the files that pertain to what a student sees after they log in to the website.

Basically, I'm going to be adapting either the Pages (by Ace) or Metronic (by keenthemes) for the gate website. Why am I doing this? Well, it saves A LOT of time for me, the (as of now) lone front-end coder, because I don't have to style everything for hours on end. Also, some languages or concepts which I'm not familiar with (Angular JS, some HTML5 aspects) are accounted for in this framework.

So before working any of the files you see here, I suggest that you familiarize yourself with the theme that I'm going to be working on, and all the syntax; you can find this all on the respective framework's documentation page.
